The goal of testingPackage is to demonstrate using the testthat library to generate testing files for R objects, specifically user-defined functions and dataframes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of testingPackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("testthat")
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TRMichelson/r_testing_demo")
```

## Guide

Open up RStudio using either the Zero-setup R-Studio with GitHub Codespaces via the instructions [here](https://github.com/BD-STEP-Tutorials/r_testing_demo/blob/main/README.md) or on your own personal machine, and view the R Markdown [starter_code.R](https://github.com/TRMichelson/r_testing_demo/blob/main/starter_code.Rmd) file included in this repository for a step-by-step tutorial on the functions used to create the testing files in the `/tests` directory.
